# Card-Maker V2
Cellular automata turned into a card maker, the second version.

## Updates
The following hsa been updated in the program:
* Updated save file encoding - Now we do things with actual bytes instead of strings
* Updated rendering - Much simpler than the previous version, and more capable
* Added three different brushes: Pencil, Eraser, Bucket
* Made it possible for user to change simulation speed

## Recovery
The code that is within this repository is not the original. The original was lost when I was trying to merge it with the main repository.
Unfortunately, we have ended up here.
The experience can be summed up with a NileRed quote: "I guess the lesson is to not do that."
